create paths by getting each nodes maximum bandwidth, if it can fit more paths add, else if the path it wants to take has a higher revenue than replace paths. otherwise take another path as max revenue has been taken out of the possible paths.

to find if a path is in the same time slot, find the index of a cleint in an arraylist, which signifies its positon.
